pos_img_train.py -> generates positive cropped images and stores them in the folder, "positive_images"
makeposfile.py -> creates info.dat file
neg_img.py -> file to read negative images and store them in the folder, "negative_images"
	      also creates bg.txt
testing_cars.py -> file to test the classifier on test images and detect if cars are present or not.

positive.vec -> file created as a result of opencv_createsamples application

haar_training -> folder containing the cascade.xml after training HAAR classifier using opencv_traincascade application
LBP_training -> folder containing the cascade.xml after training LBP classifier using opencv_traincascade application

test_cloudy -> 25 images and its corresponding ground-truth files from cloudy directory for testing
test_rainy -> 25 images and its corresponding ground-truth files from rainy directory for testing

info1.dat -> contains the filenames of all the cropped positive images, along with the number of object instances and the dimensions of the object bounded rectangle
bg1_orig.txt -> contains the absolute path of all the negative images.

Once you generate info1.dat and bg1_orig.txt, make sure you place them in "positive_images" and "negative_images", respectively.
